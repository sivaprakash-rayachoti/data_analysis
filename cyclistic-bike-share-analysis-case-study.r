The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n\n\nWith the above information we can start working on this case study as per following approach and the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze,share, and act.\n1. Stage I - Establishing clear statement of business ask and its stakeholders\n2. Stage II - Preparation of data\n        * Getting to know where and how data is located and organized\n        * Collection of data from internal and external sources\n        * Check how data is organized\n3. Stage III - Processing data\n        * Selecting the tools required\n        * Check data sets for errors and data which is not related to analysis\n        * Transform the to format which cleaning and analysis can be performed\n        * Document the cleaning and manipulation process, so that it can be referred when required\n4. Stage IV - Analysing data\n        * Organizing and formmating data to suit for analyzing \n        * Perform calculation and \n        * identify trends and pattrens in data\n5. Stage V - Sharing analysis findings\n        * Understading the findings from analysis and determining the best way to share\n        * Creat effective data visulizations \n        * Present findings from analysis\n        \n* Upon completion of above processes , data can be sent for archiving till the completion of campaign, if required data can be referred in the implemention of analysis findings.\n* Also upon successful implementation of markting plan, if data no longer is required, same can be destroy/erase.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-18T15:37:13.020813Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-18T15:37:13.066404Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-18T15:38:15.130163Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**STAGE-I**\n\nBusiness ask :-\n* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\nStakeholders :-\n- Lily Moreno :- The director of marketing and your manager.
